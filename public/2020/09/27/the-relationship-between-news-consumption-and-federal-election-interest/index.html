<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The 2015 Canadian federal election was held October 19, 2015. Liberal party leader, Justin Trudeau, ended the nine-year reign of Stephen Harper to become the 23rd Canadian Prime Minister (Zurcher, 2015). The Canadian Election Study (CES) is a survey conducted to examine Canadians’ opinions regarding political parties, election campaigns and party leaders (Northrup, 2016). This study has been an integral part of Canadian democracy research since 1965 (Fournier, 2015).</p>
<p>As per reports, voter turnout increased 7.2 percent from 2011 to 2015, marking the largest rise in turnout since 1900 (Voter Turnout). I am interested in exploring whether surveys of Canadians’ political interest correlate with this increase in voter turnout in the 2015 election. Additionally, I would like to follow up by exploring whether news consumption could be a factor for the distribution of interest in the 2015 Canadian federal election.</p>
<p>In order to investigate these properties, I will graph two survey results from the 2015 CES. The first is the distribution of interest in the 2015 federal election. The second graphed result is the distribution of news consumption in the 2015 CES. I will be comparing their distributive properties to see if there is a correlation between news consumption and interest in the federal election.</p>
<p>I hypothesize that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The distribution of interest in the 2015 federal election will represent a right-skewed distribution. The null hypothesis is that the distribution of interest in the 2015 federal election will not represent a right-skewed distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>The distributions of news consumption and interest in the federal election will both be right skewed. The null hypothesis is that both the distributions of news consumption and interest in the federal election will not be right-skewed.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>We reject the null hypothesis that the distribution of interest in the 2015 federal election will not represent a right-skewed distribution. As Elections Canada has found, voting in the election and political interest are, in fact, related (Explaining the Turnout). This is further exemplified in the graph of the distribution of federal election interest. The right-skewed nature of this graph shows that the majority of individuals reported between 7-10 level of interest in the upcoming election. This high level of interest could be a reason as to why there was a reported 7.4 percent increase in voter turnout from 2011 to 2015. According to Elections Canada, 16.1 percent of individuals who did not vote in the election cited a lack of interest as the catalyst for their decision (Explaining the Turnout). Therefore, interest is a large contributing factor to voter turnout.</p>
<p>We fail to reject the null hypothesis that both the distributions of news consumption and interest in the federal election will not be right-skewed. As seen in the two graphs above, the distributive properties of these two data sets do not line up. While news consumption follows a normal distribution, the interest levels in the election follow a right-skewed distribution. This may suggest that higher number of hours spent watching, reading or listening to the news is not correlated with higher levels of interest in the election.</p>
