      <description>Author: Alen Mitrovski  Abstract In this paper, I looked into the distributions of news consumption and election interest in the 2015 Canadian Election Study. Using R, I was able to graph these results and examine their distributive properties. I hypothesized that the distributions of news consumption and interest in the federal election will both be right skewed. As a result of examining the graphs, I concluded that the distribution of federal election interest was right skewed, whereas, the distribution of news consumption followed a normal distribution.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
