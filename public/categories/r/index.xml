      <description>Abstract My abstract.
 Introduction The 2015 Canadian federal election was held October 19, 2015. Liberal party leader, Justin Trudeau, ended the nine-year reign of Stephen Harper to become the 23rd Canadian Prime Minister (Zurcher, 2015). The Canadian Election Study (CES) is a survey conducted to examine Canadiansâ€™ opinions regarding political parties, election campaigns and party leaders (Northrup, 2016). This study has been an integral part of Canadian democracy research since 1965 (Fournier, 2015).</description>
